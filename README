R.Lichen is a R package for visualizing networks in the web browser.

Basic useage is:
bionetwork(adjList,list( center="RTK", height=height, width=width,padding=80,layout_data=googleDataTable(layoutdata)))

To visualize a graphNEL n:
adjList = matrix(unlist(strsplit(edgeNames(n),"~")),ncol=2,byrow=TRUE)
adjList = cbind(adjList,TRUE)
bionetwork(adjList,list(layout="extendedForceDirected", continuousUpdates=TRUE, nodeClusters=googleDataTable(clusterMat), height=height, width=width,padding=80))

It is in a pre release state, please see test.R, gbmbase.R, stresstest.R for 
examples of its use and http://github.com/ryanbressler/Lichen for
